## Project

Above the camera app, we will have a button to capture a photo and another to record a video. We will use the Vision Camera library to capture the images and videos. We will use the Expo Image and Video libraries to save the images and videos in the local device. We will use the Expo Media Library to save the images and videos in the local device.

Initial start.
